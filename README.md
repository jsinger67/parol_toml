# ATTENTION - This project was moved to [parol](https://github.com/jsinger67/parol)

You can find it in `parol`'s workspace [here](https://github.com/jsinger67/parol/tree/main/examples/toml).

There is no further development in this repository here.

# Example application "TOML Parser"

This is an example project of the [`parol`](https://github.com/jsinger67/parol) parser generator.

ALL CODE WAS GENERATED BY PAROL.

The scaffolding of the crate was done by invoking `parol new`.
The parser generation then was done by `parol` in the `build.rs` build script evaluating the content
of `parol_toml.par` grammar definition file.

`parol` generated all AST types automatically solely from the grammar description. The parser code
fills these AST data structures automatically during parsing so that at the end of the parsing
process the parsed input exits in a transformed form.

This TOML parser acts as an acceptor and can compile all files from the [toml-test](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test.git)
crate that contain positive tests. Negative tests will mostly fail because no semantic checks are
implemented in this example.

## Performance evaluation

For best performance results please use a release build and add the parameter -q (quiet) after the
file name.

But keep in mind that this crate is designed for didactical usage and therefore performance is not
the main goal. Especially the parse tree generation and visualization is active which is usually not
the case for a production version.
